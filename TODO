Periodic:
- upgrade tools and plugins
  update own repos as part of it

Cleaning:

Bugs:
  - local_copy doesn't remove old files from the target directories
    probably we should use rsync or so (in remote_copy to then)
    need to be careful because some manual config files should be kept (mutt gpg config)
  - http prompt issue with body value "products:='[]'"

Testing:
  - vim ctrlp root marker doesn't seem to work correctly with multiple repos
  - idem for vim gutentags root marker

Improvements:
  - add sourcing of local tmux config files
  - start_konsole_env: order tabs by title number after all launches
  - split configuration files between plugins conf and core conf
  - split core configuration files between general / style / bindings .conf files
    (or other meaningful split, like by extensions type for mopidy)
    and let the setup script concat and rename them if needed

New Features:
  - add keyboard config files with xkb
  - tmux env: switch to root user with password
    check https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox#alternatives
  - vim and zsh config for remote servers
  - ALSA equalizer presets
  - htop config (with vim key bindings patch?)
  - readline config for vi mode in cli tools (mysql, redis, influxdb, mycli?,...)
  - https://github.com/1995eaton/chromium-vim cvimrc

Discarded:
  - combine ssh remote commands to lower execution times
    by decreasing number of connections
    => not really needed for now, better keep things clear
  - split setup script (display/helper/... functions)
    => not really needed for now, better keep structure simple
  - add script to update all tools' plugins (including plugins managers themselves)
    => better be done manually to see the changes and make adaptation
  - move all tools to XDG base directories as much as possible
    => moved the ones that support it natively
       some might be worked around https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory_support
       but it's not worth it given that some would stay fully hardcoded outside them
       (or maybe we should create symlinks then?...)
  - tmux env: the layouts are not set correctly
    this seems to be because the terminal sizes from which the tmux commands are run
    might be different than the ones from where the client is attached afterwards
    => not a big problem
